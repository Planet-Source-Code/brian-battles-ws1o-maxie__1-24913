MaxIE 1.01

All this does is sit in the System Tray and allow the user to minimize or maximize all active instances of Microsoft Internet Explorer

Written in Visual Basic 6.0 (sp5), tested with Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional and Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.x and 6.0

Some code snippets came from fine VB programmers on Planet Source Code (http://www.planetsourcecode.com/vb/)
 
Freeware, do what you want, just don't sell it or claim you wrote it!

Windows 2000 and Internet Explorer are copywrited/trademarked by Microsoft, etc (duh!)
